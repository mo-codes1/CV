## Mohammed Salah

A Ruby and JavaScript Web Developer who is currently working on the front-end but also has interest in the back-end. Having had a short career as an Electrical Engineer, my thirst for problem solving and critical thinking makes me a developer focused on the finer details. 

Tech is the future and being a part of shaping that future for the better is why I am really excited to get in the industry.
